**About frameworks:**

Frameworks are wonderful things you can get a lot done with the framework but the author of the framework does not know you and does not care about you the author of the framework does not understand your problems is not writing code to solve your problems they are writing code to solve their problems when you use a framework you make an enormous commitment to that framework you bind your code to it in the very worst case you derive from base classes in the framework, the framework author makes no such commitment to you it is a terribly asymmetric relationship and as an architect if you are an architect or if you’re designer you must be very skeptical of that relationship because you should be thinking that this framework is out to screw me, you should be looking very very carefully at how much you bind to it read the directions you know the documents that the framework author writes, read those directions but you do not follow those directions because the directions that the framework author writes will tell you to couple to the framework intimately because he loves the framework you don’t have to so then what you do is you put the framework behind in architectural boundary you draw those black lines again then you put the framework behind that boundary and you use it but you use it a very careful way so that one day when that framework no longer satisfies your needs you will have some options how many of you have used a framework built it into your system coupled it so tightly into your the system only to find out two years laters there’s a much better framework out there but you have no way to get it there because you are so inextricably bound. You start out with a framework and it’s wonderful it lets you go fast but then a few months later you want to do something that the framework doesn’t want to let you do and the framework starts to fight you, they’re lovely things but they are not pure good they are tools and like any tool, you better know how to use them and how to keep yourself at some distance from them.
